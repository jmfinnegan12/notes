I am interested in financial markets, data driven strategy, and challenging myself. I am currently working as a solo prop trader. These are my public notes.

Built with Quartz and Obsidian. Work in progress (always will be)

# About This Site
The main goal is an honest recap of my journey. The most valuable and impactful resources I have found have been compiled by individuals like me. I want to pay it forward and connect with like-minded people along the way.

I started this site to compile, organize, and publicize my notes on my journey. I want to contribute to lowering the barriers to entry to this opaque but [[Nobility of Quant Trading|noble]] profession. I like the "[[digital garden]]" idea. I take a lot of notes about a variety of topics in Obsidian, and over time I will populate this site with some that I think are worth sharing.

# About Me
I began as an engineer, went back to grad school, dropped out to work as an analyst on a commodities desk, progressed to junior trader, quit and started on my own. Academia and corporate jobs were not my calling.

Successful traders must incorporate cross-disciplinary knowledge, solve problems creatively, and learn and adapt constantly. In that sense, a successful trader must be a polymath, which is a major reason I am drawn to the profession. 

I am also deeply interested in productivity, organization, mindfulness, personal knowledge management, and many other related topics that I group under the umbrella of "[[Self Mastery]]". I am an avid reader of a variety of genres. Like many other traders, I am also a poker player.

Outside of my intellectual and professional ambitions, I love outdoor adventure (fly fishing, backpacking/trekking, and backcountry skiing), endurance running, stand up comedy, and world travel. Currently struggling to get as much as I can of all of these things in my life while I grow my trading.
